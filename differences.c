//run program using gcc and not g++

//endl dont works here we use \n

//include<stdio.h> and not #include<iostream>

//cout<<output; dont works here, use printf(output);
//for taking input you have to write scanf("%type",&variable)

//for pointers or addresses we use %u 
//similar to %d for int
//similar to %f for float
//similar to %lf for double
//similar to %c for char

//use Alt + Shift to write in lines together

//strings are very different here.
